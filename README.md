# distributed_learning_simulator

This is a simulator for distributed Machine Learning and Federated Learning on a single host. It implements common algorithms as well as our works. The code is currently considered unstable and undergoes modifications over time, so take it with your risk.

## GTG Shapley Value

To run the algorithms of [GTG-Shapley: Efficient and Accurate Participant Contribution Evaluation in Federated Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3501811), use this command

```
bash gtg_shapley_train.sh
```
